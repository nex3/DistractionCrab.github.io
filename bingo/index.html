			If you're looking for bingo related things see 
			<a href="/bingo/web">here</a> for web-based bingo boards. These are
			designed to be used in OBS. To properly crop out extraneous features, crop using the mouse and
			not a filter and you'll be able to interact properly with the bingo board through
			OBS. See <a href="distractioncrab.github.io/bingo/MIU">here</a> for bingo stuff related to
			the MixItUp bot, which allows bingo minesweeper and interactive chat games for Twitch.
