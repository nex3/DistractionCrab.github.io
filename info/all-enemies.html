		<h1><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h1>

		TL;DR: Kill all enemies as defined below.

		What defines an enemy in this case: An enemy is an NPC in the game that will become hostile/attack you when you approach (walk up to it, and be in physical contact with). For some configuration of your character to the enemy, as you approach, if they aggro, they are an enemy. This includes NPCs which become hostile as a result of questlines, which must be done in a maximal manner. By maximal we mean the largest amount of questlines fulfilled, not necessarily the number of NPC's; What this means if there are two branching quest-lines in which one line has two enemies and the other has one, you can choose at your discretion. There's no good way to have this work for these games, without a bunch of tedium and would not be interesting. Invasions must also be done, even though they are not technically killed.

		<h2>General Rules Across All Games</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Since all runs enforce a particular "in-order" run, and leaving enemies behind requires a full reclear of an area, enemies which become inaccessible due to clipping through the world, but not officially dying can be considered dead. This rule exists because these games are extremely buggy, especially when in an area for so long, and is extremely likely for enemies to be inaccessible upwards of 90% of the time.</li>

			<li>Souls are not required to be gained for an enemy to be considered "dead," for example the second skeleton in DS1 catacombs falls to their "death," but no souls are acquired. This is a very uncommon situation, but this also makes it less tedious by not having to often reclearing an area because of an odd edge-case.</li>

			<li>
				NPC characters, such as the Firekeeper or Andre, which do not become hostile passively are not required.
			</li>
			<li>
				Hostile NPC's either through questlines or otherwise can be killed while they are passive, as long as it doesn't prevent you from killing other enemies locked by that NPC
			</li>

			<li>Bonfires may only be used once their corresponding previous area has been cleared of all 	enemies, or in the case of Elden Ring each grace can only be used once.
			</li>

			<li>Bonfires may be used multiple times; However, any enemies killed in a section that wasn't fully cleared, must be rekilled (this does not include Elden Ring)</li>

			<li>You may activate a bonfire (but not use it) before it's been unlocked to allow easier travel.</li>

			<li>Standard No-Hit rules apply.</li>

			<li>Friendly NPC's do not need to be killed, but can be as necessary.</li>


			<li>If you accidentally rest at a bonfire, and forget any enemy in that section, you must reclear the whole area.</li>

			<li>Saving and quitting is allowed ONLY after resting at new bonfire, teleporting back to Firelink and satisfying the requirements of resting at said bonfire, and have no aggroed NPCs in Firelink.</li>
			<li>
				Crystal Lizard style enemies don't need to be killed; They don't fit the definition of an enemy, they despawn meaning in order clearings almost require multiple runthroughs just to handle these, and in DeS they can just despawn and never come back. Thus there are little motivation to require these. This however does not include the hostile versions in Bloodborne, which must be handled.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mimic style enemies must be killed, even though they are not targetable or hostile unless attacked, they are deemed an enemy even though they're cool.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>General Rules</h2> 

		<ol>
			<li>Due to World Dependency, Pure Black tendency is not achievable, and so hostile enemies cannot be accessed. However, the friendly NPC version can be in Pure White tendency and instead you must kill them. Note that killing NPC's lower tendency so make sure to do this after everything else.</li>

			<li>Certain cutoff areas (such as in 1-1, 3-1, and 5-1), which require pure tendencies, must be done, but can be done at any time.</li>

			<li>For the "order" of the run, you do not need to go 1->2->3->... but can do orders such as 1-1 -> 4-1 -> 2-1, but you must make sure to fully clear them as stated before.</li>

			<li>The NPC's in the Nexus do not need to be killed, except for Yurt, he will always become hostile (once freed).</li>
		</ol>

		<h1 class='center'> <a id="ds1rules"></a>Dark Souls I</h1>
		<br><br>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Order of areas is convoluted, instead designated areas must be cleared as they are entered so your journey is "in-order."
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h1 class='center'> <a id="ds2rules"></a>Dark Souls II</h1>
		<br><br>

			</li>
		</ol>

		<h1 class='center'> <a id="ds3rules"></a>Dark Souls III</h1>
		
		<br><br>

		<h2>General Rules</h2> 
		<ol>
			<li>The enemies which must be killed are those which are targetable without provocation. The exceptions are baby crystal lizards in a loaded area, and the smouldering flesh in the lava in the demon ruins (requires a bow/magic to be consistent). If you decide to allow  bows for your run, the Smouldering Flesh in the lava must be killed.</li>
			
			<li>
				Areas must be done in "order:"
				<ol>
					<li>Graves</li>
					<li>Highwall</li>
					<li>
						Settlement (can be split into first and second part after tree door/cornyx archway)
					</li>
					<li>Road of Sacrifices</li>
					<li>Sage+cathedral</li>
					<li>Poison Swamp</li>
					<li>Catacombs</li>
					<li>Demon Ruins</li>
					<li>Irithyll</li>
					<li>Either Dungeon or Anor Londo first, but If Pontiff is done before dungeon, Aldrich must follow</li>
					<li>Untended Graves</li>
					<li>Lothric Castle</li>
					<li>Grand Archives</li>
					<li>Cinder/Nameless</li>
					<li>Ashes of Ariandel</li>
					<li>Ringed City</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

			<li>Bonfires may be used multiple times; However, any enemies killed in a section that wasn't fully cleared, must be rekilled.</li>

			<li>Sections must be contiguous; This means you cannot "start" a section to get an item, and start another area. Homeward bones are not banned, but if the section was not cleared, then it must be fully recleared.</li>

			

			<li>The enemies in the Ancient Wyvern arena must be killed before killing the wyvern.</li>

			<li>In Ringed City Swamp; The smaller locusts either need to be killed or chased until they bury themselves and cannot be found. They become untargetable unless provoked at this point. This also handles the issue if they bury themselves, and cannot be found for whatever reason.</li>


			<li>Cathedral Graveyard: Due to enemies respawning (sometimes infinitely), and due to the inconsistency with with verifying infinite respawns, the enemies that need to be killed are the maggot-exposed zombies (those zombies which have maggot creatures protruding from their bodies).</li>

			<li>
				General Enemies that must be killed, even when aforementionedly excluded: 
				<ul>
					<li>DLC Invasions</li>
					<li>Mimics</li>
					<li>Shira</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				General Notes about special cases:
				<ul>
					<li>Highwall wyvern cannot be targeted at all, it also can only be killed with sufficentially high damage.</li>
					<li>Highwall wyvern event relocates, but can be made to relocate earlier with a bow (drops 1 LTS)</li>
					<li>Highwall Darkwraith is not missable, leonhard drops the key.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h1 class='center'> <a id="bbrules"></a>Bloodborne</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Cleric Beast and Gascoigne are both required for the lanterns they unlock; i.e. to use either lantern both bosses must be dead.
			</li>
			<li>
				All non-root chalices are required to be completed. Root chalices are banned and not allowed for farming.
			</li>
			<li>
				You cannot progress to NG+ to get easier items for chalices.
			</li>
			<li>
				Forbidden woods can be split: First section is up to the elevator that connects to the first lantern. Second is from there to shadows.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cainhurst can be split: First section is up to the elevator shorcut (excluding the enemies in the same room). Second is from the elevator to Logarius.
			</li>
			<li>
				Going towars Iosefka's clinic from the Forbidden woods can be done as desired since loading that area will respawn the whole forest. However, if the first section of the forest isn't completed and you go it must be recleared. Note this respawn happens after the poison swamp, and the poison swamp is part ofthe forest section.
			</li>
			<li>
				When in the chalices, Blood Lickers will spawn when you kill an enemy with a Visceral, when this happens you must ensure that if it does spawn it dies. No Blood Lickers are allowed to be left alone. This means you must track your viscerals, and make sure to visit enemies killed by viscerals and make sure they don't spawn and if they do spawn, they are killed.
			</li>
